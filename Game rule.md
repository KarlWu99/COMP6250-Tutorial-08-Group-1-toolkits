# Basic description of this game

When a company/organization encounters a problem during a project and needs to make a decision, there are usually different members who propose different solutions, but only the best solution is used in the final execution.The game is designed to help managers choose the best option. 

The game is similar to Catan Dice - Island 1. Players will use the resources obtained by answering questions on question cards they selected to obtain the corresponding type of resources, and then use these resources to build roads, settlements, cities and knights to get scores. Each question card will have a topic (stakeholders, teamwork, ethics, environment, or society), and the questions above are related to its card topic, which are non-technical problems that the solution may encounter. If the player is unable to successfully answer these questions, the risk of the player's solution is reflected in the game in the form of reduced scores and no access to resources. At the end of turn 10, the player with the highest score represents the solution with the lowest potential risk.

To reduce the randomness of the game and improve the reflection of decision-making ability in the game, at the beginning of the turn, the player will need to specify the type and number of questions to be answered (up to 5 questions with any type). If the answer is successful, the corresponding resources will be obtained. If the answer fails, not only cannot obtain resources but also directly deduct scores (-1). This means that the winner's solution not only with low non-technical risk but also shows that the player representing the solution has sufficient decision-making ability and adaptability.

# Introduction to the rules

- Participants
  - Players:
    - If there are N solutions, then will need N players, each player (Usually group leader) represents a solution.
  - God:
    - The manager, project owner or shareholder of the project.

- Preparation.
  - Each player needs a game board and a pen.
  - Each player needs to list 5 social technical questions about the project for each category, God needs to check and remove duplicate questions and put them in the question pool by the category.

- Play method.
  - Step 1: Players randomly draw a specified number (determined by the player) of question cards (up to 5, each of them can be of any category) from the question card pool. For example, the player can specify to draw 2 stakeholder question cards, 2 ethical question cards, and 1 social question card.
  - Step 2: Players answer all the questions on the question card drawn and return the question card to the question pool after answering. If the answers are successful, the player gets the corresponding resource cards from the god. (Answer will be judge by god, see "Judgement" below)
  - Step 3: Players can swap resources (using Knights, see "Swaps" below), and use resources to build (road, settlement, city or knight). Players can build multiple structures on the same turn, as long as they have enough resources to build all of them (need to meet building constraints, see "Building Constraints" below).
  - Step 4: When the player cannot take any more actions, they add up the scores of all structures built during the turn and add it to their scoreboard. The remaining resources at the end of the round are lost (return to the god), which means that there is no accumulation of resources between rounds.
  - Step 5: Repeat Step 1 to 4.
  - Step 6: The game ends when all players complete their 10th turn.

- Judgement.
  - God needs to judge whether each player's answer is reasonable. If other players have any objection to this answer, they can raise it to God.
  - If the player answers the question successfully, they will get the corresponding resource card, otherwise, 1 point will be directly deducted.

- Building Constraints.
  - Similar to Catan Dice - Island 1, in addition to having available resources, there are certain restrictions on the order in which structures are built:
    - Roads, settlements and cities must form a connected network starting from the initial road.
    - Settlements, Cities and Knights must be built in order of increasing points value. For example, a player must have built both the 3-point and 4-point settlements before they can build the 5-point settlement.

- Swaps.
  - Swapping resources using Knights.
    - Once a Knight is built, it can be used once per game to swap a resource. Knights numbered 1 to 5 each allows the player to swap one of the available resources of their choice for ore, grain, wool, and brick respectively. (This is shown by a resource icon below each Knight on the game board.) Knight 6 is a wildcard: it can be used to swap one of the available resources of the player's choice for one of any of the other resources.

- Game End.
  - The game ends when all players complete their 10th turn. The winner is the player with the highest score.
