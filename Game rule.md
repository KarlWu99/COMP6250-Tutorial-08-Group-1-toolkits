*Basic Rule Of the Game

When a company/organization encounters a problem during a project and needs to make a decision, there are usually different members who propose different solutions, but only the best solution is used in the final execution.The game is designed to help managers choose the best option. 

The game is similar to Catan Dice - Island 1. Players will use the resources obtained by answering questions on question cards they selected to obtain the corresponding type of resources, and then use these resources to build roads, settlements, cities and knights to get scores. Each question card will have a topic (stakeholders, teamwork, ethics, environment, or society), and the questions above are related to its card topic, which are non-technical problems that the solution may encounter. If the player is unable to successfully answer these questions, the risk of the player's solution is reflected in the game in the form of reduced scores and no access to resources. At the end of turn 10, the player with the highest score represents the solution with the lowest potential risk.
